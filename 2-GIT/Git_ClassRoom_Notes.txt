Git and Bitbuket
----------------
-  Git is Source code manager-SCM, it is also called as Version Control System.

Why we need SCM?
- It helps multiple developers to contribute to same code base.
- SCM tools version your source code, if anything wrong with latest code, you can quickly rollback to previous working code.
- SCM tools also record all changes along with 
    - Who changed the files
	- Why it is changed
	- Timestamp, when it was changed.
- Tracking defects is easy
- we can secure the code using SCM tools, you can manage users and grant access to only authorised engineers
- every developes will give access.

Who need this tool?
- Not only developer every must know SCM everybody use it.

Why we should learn SCM as a Devops?

- We manage configuration files while working with
   1.Ansible
   2.Docker
   3.Jenkins
   4.Kubenatees
SO we also must know to use SCM tools.
 ansible palybook
 dockerfile palybooks
 kubenetees configuration all we commit.

Other SCM tools:
  - IBM clearcase - licensed product
  - Tortoise SVN
  - CVS
  - Microsoft TFS

Why Git?  
  1. Open Source And Free
  2. Git is fast and distributed Vesion Control System
  3. Has more compreshensive features that any other tools
        - have easy solutions

Distributed Version Control:
  - Along with Git remote server, every copy on developers local machine behaves like a server.
  - It allows you to work locally.

Central Version Control:  
 - In this case only one server behaved like SCM server.  
  
  - Distributed in the sense hosted on every m/c.
  - performance is better
  - we can scale up
  - Oracle  oracle   oracle
    linux   linux    linux
  - same db hosting in diff m/c- its live on diff m/c.
  - its duplicating the code. we have a copy. if server is down still we have copy.most recent copy
  - it wont reach every time to remote server. In case, svn goto remote server.
  - for every thing not communicating with server.unnessecrly.
  - not saying central server not required. it required to make centralize and merge the code.
  - you will have only one master copy.
  

My version:
- its going to version your code for every change give the version
- you will get track of modifications
- it record the all the things
- some people called SCM, some people called VCS.

if ask any question not clear - ellobarate and more specific


Setting Up git Server:

- Hosted Git. i.e downloaded git and configure and maintain it on your own server.
- Cloud based Git, Some third party maintains servers and git, you are just using it over internet.

Creating Cloud account for Git:
------------------------------
- Bitbucket - its add more value.
- GitHub (Microsoft Bought Github)
- Gitlab
- CodeCommit in AWS
