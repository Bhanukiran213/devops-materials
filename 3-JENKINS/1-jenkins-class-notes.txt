Countinous Integration(CI)
=====================

It is a process where bunch of developers push their changes every day to the SCM(Source Code Manager) like gitHub, then take the latest code and run builds(maven) on this code & generate an artifact. This process called as Integration Process. If we repeat this process again and again it is called as Countinous Integration(CI).

--> The objective of CI is find syntatical and functional errors as early as possible which lets developers to fix them immediately. That is the idea behind CI.

--> To implement CI process, there are CI tools like Jenkins, Bamboo, Team City,Circle CI,solano,Hudson. 90% use jenkins as a CI server

--> Jenkins also have enterprise version called cloudbees.

--> Lets begin with Jenkins.

open source vs enterprise version
----------------------------------
enterprise version - get support immediately
open source version - free and support wont be there


Jenkins
======
It is a popular open source CI tool which provides lots of inbuild functionalities.
- Jenkins is depending on JAVA. bcoz jenkins developed on JAVA.
   
   jenkins version below 2.x jdk 7 required
   jenkins version above jdk 8 required
   
   search 1.8 package
   sudo yum list | grep java-1.8 // it will listout all openjdks - choose devel.
   yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel.x86_64
   devel - compiler +jvm   - openjdk -devel is required becoz jenkins compile and run java applications
   
   java -version
   javac -version // both should have same version if not update alternatives
   
   // when you have multiple version 
   update-alternatives --config java
   1****
   2  // run on to programmes
   
   if jenkins on docker its bundled with all dependencies.
   

Steps to install Jenkins in CentOS or Linux
-----------------------------------------------------------------

For Java based applications, the prerequitites for using Jenkins server is 
           1. JDK
           2. Maven
           3. Git

Installation of Jenkins
--------------------------
Install Jdk in Ec2 linux instance:
---------------------------------
   sudo yum list | grep java-1.8 // it will listout all openjdks - choose devel.
   yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel.x86_64
   
To install Jenkins,
$ sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
  sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
  yum install jenkins

To verify the status of Jenkins,
$ sudo service jenkins status

To start the Jenkins
$ sudo service jenkins start

To restart jenkins automatically when VM restarts,
$ sudo chkconfig jenkins on

By default Jenkins use 8080 port number
To access jenkins from web browser,    
192.168.70.10:8080

Jenkins Configuration:
----------------------
- open a browser and access with ipaddress:8080
- provide the initialpassword
- Customize Jenkins
  - Jenkins comes with 100 of plugins select install all plugin 
- Create First Admin User - dont forget to mention

Creating a first Jenkins Job
----------------------------

- The objective is take the project source from github use maven to run a build on this project and generate artifact.
- When we ran this job the build failed saying mvn clean package......
- In our case mvn is in the path, Jenkins is not able to ...... we can configure maven installation location.

Steps to configure maven installation location
----------------------------------------------

Jenkins Home -> Manage Jenkins -> Global Tool Configuration -> Add Maven

In a Jenkins, using jenkins job not only build it can perform any kind of activity. for example, executing script, creating & deleting a folder.

Example2: 
---------

Using previous job, instead of manual build, we can automated process.... every hour
Open ims-dev project-> Click configure under Build Triggers -> Select Build periodically
*/1****

Example3:
---------

Trigerring a build only when there is a change in git repository.
Under build trigerrs we must enabled "Build when a change is pushed to gitHub" and "Poll SCM"

Jenkins Workspace
-----------------
It is a location in the Jenkins server where a project is clone and maven goal is executed.

Configuring Email notifications
----------------------------------------

- For this congiguration initially we need to set up SMTP server

Configuring Gmail SMTP server
------------------------------------

- SMTP is a server used for sending & receiving emails

- In Jenkins Home, Manage Jenkins-->Congiguration-->Email Notification


How Jenkins find changes in SCM? 

- It maintain last revision number in log file.

- Plugins are maintained by the Jenkins under Jenkins home/plugin
   Jenkins--> Manage Jenkins--> manage plugins


Master-Slave Cingigurations in Jenkins
===========================================

The idea of Master-slave to distubue jobs acrpss the mutiple servers which decreases/reduces load on single server.
Jenkins Home--> Manage Jenkins --> Manage Nodes--> New Node

How to configure a job to run under slave?
while configure a job select the option "restrict where this project can be run" and put lable of the slave.

User Management
===============

Jenkins Home--> Manage Jenkins--> Manage Users--> Create a user

Jenkins Home--> Manage Jenkins--> Configure Global Security


Web Servers
===========
Web servers are helpful for running web based applications.

Web apps are two kinds
1. Static web apps - which uses a plain html
2. Dynamic web apps - 


For Dynamic web apps we can use php, servlets & JSP, ASP .net, python etc...

*** Why we need web servers & what functionalities it provides for us?
Ans: 1. Web servers provides implemention of http & https protocols.
     2. Web servers provide in built multithreading support.
     3. They do provide in-built security.

  Different web servers available in the market.
           1. Apache tomcat
           2. Oracle weblogic
           3. IBM Websphere
           4. SUN Glassfish
           5. JBoss 
           6. Apache

1. Apache tomcat:
=================

Installing tomcat: 
Latest version as of today is tomcat 9, but most of the applications used tomcat 7&8

Pre-requisite:
--------------
JDK is a prerequisite for tomcat.

Step 1: Change Directort into /opt
Step 2: use wget & downloading tomcat

Starting a tomcat:

1. cd into tomcat home/bin

[root@localhost bin]# pwd
/opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.9/bin
[root@localhost bin]#

Stop


Tomcat users 8080 has adefault port number

Deploying Web application in tomcat
===================================

There are different ways to deploy web application in tomcat

OPtion 1: take the war file & put it in tomcat hom/webapps

- Take the war file from server1 & place it in server2 tomcat/webapps folder

How many ways to run the jenkins
--------------------------------
- using Docker

- using package mgmr yum install

- d/w jenkins war file and deploy it on tomcat.
