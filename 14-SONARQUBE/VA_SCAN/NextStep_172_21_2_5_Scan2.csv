vulnerability.","The remote Windows host has an installation of .NET Core
with a version less than 2.0.5. Therefore, the host is affected
by multiple vulnerabilities :

  - A security feature bypass in X509 Certificate Validation
    allows an attacker to present a certificate that is
    marked as invalid for a specific use, but a component
    uses it for that purpose. (CVE-2018-0786)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists due to improper
     processing of XML documents. An attacker who
     successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause
     a denial of service against a .NET application. A
     remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this
     vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests
